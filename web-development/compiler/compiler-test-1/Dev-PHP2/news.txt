+ NEW [] (dysmas2) Options : Add a ToDo tab sheet in order to deal with several 'tracker' formats (tracker_ID/folderID, 0 being the default folder, the first letter of a folderID is generally sufficient)
* CHG [] (dysmas2) Search : "Selection" and "Log results" seem to be exclusive. So, the controls of the form must work the same.
* CHG [] (dysmas2) Search : Use "Current file" instead of "Global" in the form.
* CHG [] (dysmas2) Replace : The option "Prompt on replace" is useless. Consider replacing that option by "Log results". By the way, "Prompt on replace" *is* an implicit option, now.
* CHG [] (dysmas2) Class : "Globals" are pretty useless, put them at the end of the tree structure.
* CHG [] (dysmas2) Todo list : Wrong recognition of "todo" markers - The scanner / parser has been completly rewritten
* CHG [] () L10N : New msgid (Options - To-do)="URI format - %s will be replaced by tracker ID"
- FIX [2823631] (dysmas2) Save All : Doesn't go back to active file. Then, looking for the active file is a stupid waste of time
- FIX [2823967] (nobody) Class : Sometimes, a double-click on an "Include" item doesn't open the right file - looks like a problem with the sort order. It's fine as long as the sort order of the "Includes" is same as the order found in the file.
- FIX [] (mordef) Editor : Apply Cut or Copy to current line - even on a "not selected and empty" line ; paste then undo then undo must work.
- FIX [] (dysmas2) Search : Access violation when starting an instant search <Ctrl+F3> followed by a standard search <Crl+F>

* CHG [] (dysmas2) GUI : The last icon from the Debug toolbar (eval expression) is useless
- FIX [] (dysmas2) Options : Modifying Options while PHP and/or Xdebug engines are running must be disabled because this crashes Dev-PHP

* CHG [] () Search : All in one. Current file, opened files, project file, regexp, log results, ... feature entirely rewritten
* CHG [] () L10N : New msgid "Searching...", "Regular &Expressions", "&Project files", "&Log results", "&All Yes", "A&ll No", "Formats for date and time", "Case no selection, apply Cut or Copy to current line"

- FIX [] () Class : Globals and Includes are now really sorted
@ --- 2.3.2.321 25-jun-2009

* CHG [] (dysmas2) Debug : During debugging, the setting of breakpoints must be enabled only if the status of xdebug is 'break'

* CHG [] (dysmas2) Todo list : Add an option to context menu in order to erase the contents of the displayed lists
* CHG [] () L10N : New msgid (Todo list)="Erase"
- FIX [] (dysmas2) Todo list : A quote 'like this' is not an apostrophe as in Bill's company. $dirs = glob('config*/*', GLOB_ONLYDIR); /* todo : it's not a '*/*' suffix */
+ NEW [] () GUI : Process keys Browser_back and Browser_forward to switch from tab to tab inside Editor
- FIX [] () Print Preview : The Printer icon must be disabled if there is no printer defined. Checked only once, at launch.

- FIX [] (dysmas2) Debug : The "Context" button, from Debug toolbar, must show the panel used to display variables and their contents

- FIX [] (dysmas2) Debug : php-cgi.exe requires the fullname of php.ini, not just the pathname of its directory
- FIX [2541040] (nobody) Help : Documentation/Help does not work. Project phpdoc changed the structure of the .chm, so language is no longer needed
